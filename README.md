# B84-4001

The B84-4001 keyboard PCB is a replacement PCB that makes use of the G84-4001's layout, switches, and keycaps. 
It is 83-key only, though support for G84 variants with Windows keys may be added in future.



I will gladly assist or give tips on assembly, firmware or use (you can find me on Discord as `bean#7178`), but please first read this README through.
